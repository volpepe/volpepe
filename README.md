# Hi!! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦Š

Hey everyone, I'm **Federico Cichetti**, an Italian guy who's been around since **1997**. 

ðŸ¦Š **volpepe** is my professionally-crafted fine-tuned programmer nickname, as I really love **foxes** ("volpe" in Italian).

I've graduated in **Computer Science and Engineering** with **110/110 with honours** and I'm currently studying for the master degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna**.

You can find my curriculum [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1896c7q0FP4jTZPDEyvIkTtkkrCbaBCAS/view?usp=sharing)!

# Technologies I've used

### My all time favourite technologies/languages are:
* Python, and its many libraries for machine learning/neural networks/scientific computation (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, ...)
* Bash
* Docker
* Arduino
* LaTeX

### ... but I also enjoyed using these:
* JS, HTML, CSS, PHP and all that web stuff
* Java & Scala
* SQL
* C/C++ (and a little bit of Assembly...)

# Other things about me

A great passion of mine is **video editing**! I've been editing videos since I was 15 and, more recently, I've also worked for some local companies as a freelance video-editor! Some of my works (mostly vlogs and sketches) are on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ciccosity).

I love a wide range of music genres: you can get a sense of what I usually listen from [this huge playlist](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1T4VfvXqcOVPF4iR8Cw8tI). Apart from listening, I also like to **create music**: I write, sing and play classic and electric guitar in some personal WIP musical projects. 

When I have some free time, I like watching movies or playing videogames. Here's my [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/volpepe/) and my [Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/volpepe/).
