# 👋🦊

Hey everyone, I'm **Federico Cichetti** an italian guy who's had unrestricted internet access since **1997**. 

Online, I go by **volpepe** — a lovingly finetuned nickname born from my obsession with foxes (🦊 = volpe).

## 🧠 About Me

🎓 I hold a MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering, both earned cum laude at Alma Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna.

🛠️ I'm a deep learning software engineer. I love creating and automating stuff. 

📄 [Check out my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1896c7q0FP4jTZPDEyvIkTtkkrCbaBCAS/view?usp=sharing).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

🐍 **Python**: I use it everyday, especially for machine learning, deep learning and data analysis: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas & co.

🐚🐳📜 I like automating stuff with **Bash**, containerizing chaos with **Docker** and writing my reports in **LaTeX** (it looks really good!!).

🖥️ I'm currently learning **C++** to squeeze out maximum performance from my hardware. 

🔧 I'm also trying to reconnect with some old college friends: **Java**, **Assembly**, **Arduino**.

## 🎥 Creative Side Quests

I should probably sleep more, but here's what I do instead:

✂️ **Video Editing** → Some freelance stuff + chaotic shitposting on YouTube (since I was 15!)

🎵 **Making music** → I write, sing, and play guitar in a mysterious WIP musical project

✍️ **Writing** → I've invented characters and stories for my whole life: I genuinely love trying to put them down on paper

🎭 **Roleplaying && Tabletop Gaming** → Passionate about collaborative storytelling, character drama, worldbuilding and throwing dices

🎮 **Media consuming** → [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/volpepe/) • [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/volpepe/)

🎧 **Listening to weird sounds on repeat** → [huge playlist of all my favourite songs](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1T4VfvXqcOVPF4iR8Cw8tI)
