# 👋🦊

Hey everyone, I'm **Federico Cichetti** an italian guy who's had unrestricted internet access since **1997**. 
Online, I go by **volpepe** — a lovingly finetuned nickname born from my obsession with foxes (🦊 = volpe).

## About Me

- I hold a MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering, both earned cum laude at Alma Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna.
- I'm a deep learning software engineer. I love creating stuff that learns on its own. 
- [Check out my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1896c7q0FP4jTZPDEyvIkTtkkrCbaBCAS/view?usp=sharing).

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: I use it everyday, especially for machine learning, deep learning and data analysis: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas & co.
- I like automating stuff with **Bash**, containerizing chaos with **Docker** and writing my reports in **LaTeX** (it looks really good!!).
- I'm currently learning **C++** to squeeze out maximum performance from my hardware.

## Creative Side Quests

I should probably sleep more, but here's what I do instead:
- **Video Editing**: Some freelance stuff + chaotic shitposting on YouTube (since I was 15!)
- **Making music**: I write, sing, and play guitar in a mysterious WIP musical project
- **Writing**: I've invented characters and stories for my whole life: I genuinely love trying to put them down on paper
- **Roleplaying && Tabletop Gaming**: Passionate about collaborative storytelling, character drama, worldbuilding and throwing dices
- **Media consuming**: [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/volpepe/) • [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/volpepe/)
- **Listening to weird sounds on repeat**: [huge playlist of all my favourite songs](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1T4VfvXqcOVPF4iR8Cw8tI)
