# Hi!! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦Š

Hey everyone, I'm **Federico Cichetti**, an Italian guy who's been around since **1997**. 

ðŸ¦Š **volpepe** is my professionally-crafted fine-tuned programmer nickname, as I really love **foxes** ("volpe" in Italian).

I've graduated in **Computer Science and Engineering** with **110/110 with honours** and I'm currently studying for the master degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna**.

# Technologies I really like ðŸ¥°

### My all time favourite technologies/languages are:
* Python (the **King**)
* Bash (the **Queen**)
* Java (the **Bro**)
* JavaScript (and its fella, JQuery)
* HTML + CSS
* Docker
* Arduino

### Regarding Python, I've been using it for my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects, so here's a few libraries I love working with!!:
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* Keras
* youtube-dl (lol)

### Last but not least, I loved working with these bad bois:
* Scala
* LaTeX
* C/C++ (and Assembly, just a tiny bit... ðŸ˜³)
* SQL
* Linux
* Vue.js
* Flask

I've had the pleasure to work on some really **BUFF** servers for both my thesis and other projects, and I can't thank the creators of tools such as **byobu** and **Docker** enough. They basically saved my life...

# Other things about me

I love a wide range of music genres: indie/math/prog rock, electronic of any kind, chillhop, alternative hip-hop and even classical music sometimes. You can get a sense of what I usually listen from [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1T4VfvXqcOVPF4iR8Cw8tI).

I also like watching and talking about movies. Here's my [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/volpepe/) where I log and rate all the movies I watch pretending to be a cinephile.

A great passion of mine is video editing! I've been editing videos since I was 15 and I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ciccosity) with some vlogs and stuff. I've also worked for some local companies as a freelance video-editor. I'm a self-taught Vegas Pro user, but maybe I'll switch to Premiere in the future?? Who knows!

I often indulge in gaming as well. Some of my favourite videogames are:
* Portal 2
* Hollow Knight
* Night in the Woods
* Undertale
* Fallout New Vegas
* Skyrim
* Half Life 2
* The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild
* Divinity Original Sin 2

and many more. My favourite nostalgia game is **Spyro - Year of the Dragon** from the PS1 era. I'm gonna cry if I don't find another D&D group soon.

*Ahem* Since you're reading this, here's a link to a gallery of commissions I have of [my fursona](https://imgur.com/a/SiyQ0Hx). His name is Conrad. Yeah, sorry.

You can find me on a lot of social media, but uhh... It's not a good idea to share my private profiles in here. Here are the most innocuous.
