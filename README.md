# Hi!! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦Š

Hey everyone, I'm **Federico Cichetti**, an Italian guy who's been around since **1997**. 

ðŸ¦Š **volpepe** is my professionally-crafted fine-tuned programmer nickname, as I really love **foxes** ("volpe" in Italian).

I've graduated in **Computer Science and Engineering** (did this in Cesena, my hometown) with **110/110 with honours** and I'm currently studying for my master in **Artificial Intelligence** (here I moved to Bologna: ðŸ˜²) at **Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna**. 

Here's some pointless stats:

In my bachelor's degree I've seen many languages and worked on different projects with different aims. I worked on a Frogger clone with Java and JavaFX and on a fake food delivery web-application with a team of colleagues. I've also developed a web application that interacted with the wearable brain sensing headband Muse using Web Bluetooth in my curricular internship and scripted a Blender rendering routine for automatically generating a dataset in Python for my thesis. 

This is just a clunky way to transition to the next section:

# Technologies I really like ðŸ¥°

### My all time favourite technologies/languages are:
* Python (the **King**)
* Bash (the **Queen**)
* Java (the **Bro**)
* JavaScript (and its fella, JQuery)
* HTML + CSS
* Docker

### Regarding Python, I've been using it for my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects, so here's a few libraries I've been using (and I totally love!!):
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* Keras
* youtube-dl (lol)

### Last but not least, I loved working with these bad bois:
* C/C++ (and Assembly, just a tiny bit... ðŸ˜³)
* LaTeX
* SQL
* Linux
* Vue.js
* Flask

I've had the pleasure to work on some really **BUFF** servers for both my thesis and other projects, and I can't thank the creators of tools such as **byobu** and **Docker** enough. They basically saved my life...

# Other things about me ðŸ™Š

I love a wide range of music genres: indie/math/prog rock, electronic of any kind, chillhop, alternative hip-hop and even classical music sometimes. You can get a sense of what I usually listen from [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1T4VfvXqcOVPF4iR8Cw8tI).

Even though I mostly listen to the same songs over and over, it's a playlist from two years ago, so it's not super updated. Down below you can have a clearer picture of my recent plays:

I also like watching and talking about movies. Here's my [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/volpepe/) where I log and rate all of the movies I watch pretending to be a cinephile.

A great passion of mine is video editing! I've been editing videos since I was 15 and I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ciccosity) with some vlogs and stuff. I've also worked for some local companies as a freelance video-editor. I'm a self-taught Vegas Pro user, but maybe I'll switch to Premiere in the future?? Who knows!!

I often indulge in gaming as well. Some of my favourite videogames are:
* Portal 2
* Hollow Knight
* Night in the Woods
* Undertale 
* Fallout New Vegas
* Skyrim
* Half Life 2
* The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild
* Divinity Original Sin 2

and many more. My favourite nostalgia game is **Spyro - Year of the Dragon** from the PS1 era. I used to be **obsessed** with Spyro in my childhood. I'm also a huge fan of Metroidvanias and D&D.

I'm not a big fan of cooking, but I'm trying to learn. 

Also, I'm a furry. Sorry. [Here's my fursona](https://imgur.com/a/SiyQ0Hx). His name is Conrad.

# Let's talk!ðŸ‘‚
You can find me on a lot of social media, but uhh... It's not a good idea to share my profiles in here. Here are the most innocuous.
