# Hi!! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦Š

Hey everyone, I'm **Federico Cichetti**, an Italian guy who's been around since **1997**. 

ðŸ¦Š **volpepe** is my professionally-crafted fine-tuned programmer nickname, as I really love **foxes** ("volpe" in Italian).

I've graduated in **Computer Science and Engineering** with **110/110 with honours** and I'm currently studying for the master degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna**.

# Technologies I've used

### My all time favourite technologies/languages are:
* Python, and its many libraries for machine learning/neural networks/scientific computation, including:
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * Tensorflow and Keras
  * Pytorch
  * ...
* Docker
* Java
* Bash
* Arduino

### ... but I also enjoyed using these:
* JS, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and all that web stuff
* Scala
* LaTeX
* C/C++ (and a little bit of Assembly...)

# Other things about me

I love a wide range of music genres: indie/math/prog rock, electronic of any kind, chillhop, alternative hip-hop and even classical music sometimes. You can get a sense of what I usually listen from [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1T4VfvXqcOVPF4iR8Cw8tI).

In my free time I mostly watch movies and play videogames. Here's my [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/volpepe/) and my [Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/volpepe/). 

A great passion of mine is video editing! I've been editing videos since I was 15 and I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ciccosity) with some vlogs and stuff. I've also worked for some local companies as a freelance video-editor!
